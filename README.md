## Usage
1. Run the LanguageTranslator.py script in your Python environment.
2. Enter the target language and the text you want to translate in the respective input fields.
3. Click the "Translate" button to translate the text.
4. The translated text will be displayed in the "Output Text" field.
5. Optionally, click the "Speak" button to speak the text you want to translate, and the script will recognize your speech and translate it.

## Note
